netcam is a python based network connected camera framework
utilitizing GStreamer for audio / video streaming.  netcam exposes
camera control via JSON HTTP commands or by adding other protocols
such as VISCA. netcam supports a rich set of audio / video protocols
since all the underlying GStreamer capabilities are available.

Audio / video streaming

The heart of netcam is Streamer, a python class that exposes audio /
video functionality as a set of controllable streaming
pipelines. Streamer exposes key GStreamer concepts, such as 

* text based pipeline descriptions, 
* play / pause / fast forward / rewind pipeline control,
* pipeline configuration such as frame rate, resolution, encoding
  bitrate, etc, and
* pipeline status

Device control

The camera exposes a web server allowing easy netcam viewing and
control.  The javascript running in the web browser interacts with
the camera using JSON HTTP commands.  Depending on the camera's
features, new web APIs can easily be added.

For network cameras designed for use in more conventional multi-camera
survailance deployments, protocols like VISCA can be supported to
allow for seamless integration.  Utilizing python simplifies
supporting new protocols or extending protocols that are already
supported.

The netcam Controller python module supports the device control features.

Web services

The python Web Server Gateway Interface along with Fast CGI is used to
simplify exposing the Controller API as JSON HTTP commands.  Any
compatible web server can be used, with netcam examples shown
utilizing the lighttpd web server.

The browser user interface can be supported using any javascript
framework that supports JSON.

Network services

Network services, such as Network Time Protocol, device discovery
email alerts are not directly part of netcam, but can be easily
supported using existing software technologies.
