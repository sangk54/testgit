	  If you are using a source code management system, like ClearCase, or file
	  system that doesn't allow certian files to be created, such as device files,
	  then you can have the target file system $FSROOT located in a directory other
	  that within in the development directory $DEVDIR.  If this value is not blank,
	  the the actual directory used for $FSROOT is the directory specified here, plus
	  the basename of the $DEVDIR, plus "fs".  For example, if $FS_FSROOT is
	  /opt/target_file_systems and $DEVDIR is $HOME/work/dm385sdk, then the target
	  file system can be found in /opt/target_file_systems/dm385sdk/fs.  You also
	  should change busybox install directory CONFIG_PREFIX to "arm".
