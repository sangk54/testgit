	  GD is an open source code library for the dynamic creation of
	  images by programmers.
	  
	  Important: If you wish to use PHP and GD, it is recommended to use
	  the bundled GD lib that comes with PHP. Note from the PHP website:
	  Since PHP 4.3 there is a bundled version of the GD lib. This bundled
	  version has some additional features like alpha blending, and should
	  be used in preference to the external library since its codebase is
	  better maintained and more stable. See FS_APPS_PHP_GD.
