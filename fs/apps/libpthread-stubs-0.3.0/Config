	Libpthread-stubs library. The libpthread-stubs package provides weak aliases 
	for pthread functions not provided in libc or otherwise available by default. 
	This is useful for libraries that rely on pthread stubs to use pthreads optionally. 
	On Linux, all necessary pthread functions are available, so this package is simply a placeholder.
