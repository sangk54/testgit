          The OpenSSL Project is a collaborative effort to develop a robust,
          commercial-grade, full-featured, and Open Source toolkit implementing
          the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS)
          protocols as well as a full-strength general purpose cryptography library.
          The project is managed by a worldwide community of volunteers that use
          the Internet to communicate, plan, and develop the OpenSSL toolkit and
          its related documentation.
